Hello everyone!

My name is Aleksandra Borisova.
I am an artist, illustrator, surface and textile pattern designer.
I am from Vladivostok, Russia, an amazing place where people meet the sunrise first (well, almost).
I have a degree in Environmental design, but I truly fell in love with the art a few years ago, after my first watercolour tomatoes.
Since then I am constantly searching for forms, palettes and techniques that will inspire me.
